# MyDealsUI

My Deals is to track and manage the negotiation of Intel rebates to external world-wide customers. Negotiation with the customer starts at a product-by-product Pricing Strategy.
Once these Pricing Strategies pass Meet Comp, Pricing Cost Test and the proper approval channels, rebate deals are created under 1 of 4 different Deal Types: ECAP, Program, Volume
Tier and KITs. The rebate deals are then matched at the invoice level by Downstream Applications.
