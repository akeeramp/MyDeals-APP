<h3>Entering Tenders</h3><p>As the Tender Manager is not fully completed (phase 2) tenders must be entered the same way as contracts. Upon entry you will manage them from the Tender Manager (visit the Tender Manager section for more information).  </p><div class="tip"><p class="ptip">	<img class="tipimg" src="/content/help/lightbulb.png" width="17" height="26" alt="lightbulb">	<strong>TIP:</strong> It is advised that tenders are separated into their own contracts and split into multiple pricing strategies/tables as this will help with performance. When creating a tender "contract" the Customer Acceptance status will be automatically set to Pending.	</p></div><img src="/content/help/tenders/tenders.png" width="100%" height="100%" alt="tenders"><div style="padding-top: 10px;">
