<h3>Customizing the Deal Editor</h3><p>The Deal Editor allows users to customize their tables by the creation of tabs as well as showing, hiding, and moving columns within them. The "All" tab is not removable as it will prompt you if information is needed or errors with the inputted data need correcting. Always remember to save your layout. You may always go back to the default layout by selecting default or your saved grid by selecting custom layout. </p><div class="tip"><p class="ptip">	<img class="tipimg" src="/content/help/lightbulb.png" width="17" height="26" alt="lightbulb">	<b>TIP:</b> Each customized table will be saved for the customer and a separate one for each deal type. 	</p></div><p></p><img src="/content/help/customedit/customedit.png" width="100%" height="100%" alt="customedit">
