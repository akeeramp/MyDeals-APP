<h3>Deal Editor Features</h3><p>The Deal Editor shows deals that have been validated and are ready for any minor tweaks or additional information such as Backdating, RPU, CAP, or Consumption items (they are deal specific). Some edits can be made directly in the Deal Editor grid and some are not allowed. The Deal Editor menu bar provides additional options such as saving and validating changes, hiding/viewing columns, customizing your grid, exporting your grid, and searching. Multiple tabs are defaulted at the top to help break information into downloaded chunks but can be removed or customized to your preference. The all tab will always display in case of any warnings that may need to be shown.</p><div class="tip"><p class="ptip">	<img class="tipimg" src="/content/help/lightbulb.png" width="17" height="26" alt="lightbulb">	<b>TIP:</b> Make edits in bulk by selecting all the deals you would like to edit in bulk and making a change to one.	</p></div><img src="/content/help/dealedit/dealedit.png" width="100%" height="100%" alt="dealedit"><div style="padding-top: 10px;">
