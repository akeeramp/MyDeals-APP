<!-- TODO Stylize kendo grid to fit MLAF guidelines and just look better overall.

	Some stylizing ideas that may improve some usability:
		- Add tooltip on disabled Edit/Delete buttons telling user to click a row on the grid to enable buttons
		- Make cursor = pointer when hovering over the grid items
		- Color the grid's headers differently to stand out from other rows
		- Put icon on grid headers to indicate that you can sort on the grid headers on click
		- Move action butons to top right of ng-view
		- Make the sidebar prettier. It needs a lot of work
		- Ask users how many items they want on each page of the screen, or if they even want pagination at all
		- Position icons on buttons farther away from text (for example: increase the padding from the X icon and the "Delete" text on the Delete button)
		- Remove the decimals on the number inputs in the validation pop-up
		- Remove the ID in the validation pop-up
		- Make the default yellow validation error messages not so in the way
