        <h1>My Deals Code Quality Standards</h1>
        <p>
            This is the basic standards for My Deals Code Quality in the User Interface and Middle Tier.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Check In Process</h4>
        <div style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <h6>Expectations</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>All checked-in code should compile as to not impact other developers</li>
                <li>All development should be done with local code pointed to the Dev DB Server (Standard Visual Studio practice)</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Scope</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Check-ins should be scoped to a single defect or user story.</li>
                <li>TFS check-in should have <b>comments</b> on the check-in with the <i>User Story</i> or <i>Defect</i> number in the comment</li>
                <li>Developers work in a single TFS working location. Upon selected release stages, the working version will be branched, however all new development will be done in the TFS folder path: $/RDMS/MyDeals/MyDeals_Release/UI/main</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Lightweight</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep LOC (Lines of Code) minimal. More code reviews are better than large code reviews</li>
                <li>If possible (code must work on check-in), check in large User Stories at convenient milestones to prevent large code reviews and more code redesign post the reviews.</li>
                <li>If code does not compile or code is NOT ready to be promoted through the environments, shelf the changes in TFS until ready to formally check-in.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Code Review Request</h4>
        <div style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <h6>Type of Code Review</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Small LOC check-ins (typically < 200 LOC) can rely on <b>TFS Code Review</b></li>
                <li>Large LOC check-ins (User Stories typically > 200 LOC) need a <b>Code Review Meeting</b> prior to checking in code</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Type of Code Review</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Code must be checked in prior to making a code review request.</li>
                <li>Every code check-in <b>MUST be reviewed by the UI/MT Tech Lead</b> (Philip Eckenroth for Rebel Scrum… Philip Eckenroth and Mahesh Biradar for Scrum Troopers)</li>
                <li>UI/MT Tech Lead will monitor check-ins for missing code reviews to catch check-ins without a requested code review.  This will be done through automated emails from TFS upon developer code check-in.  Lead will manually match email against code review request to locate checked code without a code review.</li>
            </ul>
