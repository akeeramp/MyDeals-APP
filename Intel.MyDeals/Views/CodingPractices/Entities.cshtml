    <h3>Coding Practices</h3>
    <p>
        The following coding practices for the Entities layer consist mainly of custom and autogenerated shared classes to be consumed by all layers of the project.
    </p>

    <h5><a href="@Url.Action("SharedClasses", "CodingPractices", new {Area = ""})">Creating a shared class</a></h5>
    <p>
        To create a class that can be consumed by all layers, the class needs to be created in the <i>Intel.MyDeals.Entities</i> project. This is the only project that is included in all layers of the project.

    <h5><a href="@Url.Action("ClassFromProcedure", "CodingPractices", new {Area = ""})">Creating a shared class from a procedure</a></h5>
    <p>
        There are many times where a stored procedure is needed to transport data.
        The best was to handle this is to create custom classes to match 1:1 the structured results.
        MyDeals uses T4 templates to help automate this process.
